# multi-snake
 * install node.js
 * host the game on a server somewhere
 * in the console, type `node multi-snake.js`
 * go to `www.whateveryourserveris.com:8080`
 * if you're the host, click "start"
 * play snake!
 * NOTE: every time you want to start the game over, you need to cancel the hosted node server and re-initialize it. this thing isn't particularly polished so i haven't included anything to restart everything.
